# go-dnd

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/HielkeFellinger/go-dnd/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HielkeFellinger/go-dnd/actions/workflows/go.yml)


This will, most likely, be nothing more than a simple gui+engine for a D&D/TTRPG oneshot, 
Build for entertainment (On LAN), with friends and getting familiar with Go.
Do NOT look at this software as an example for anything.

- Security features will be used; but will not be sufficient for more than "localhost" LAN use
- A Clean separation html/js/css will be done later if at all (Will look into HTMX)
- Most libraries used are chosen on nothing more than "Looks cool, I want to try that"
